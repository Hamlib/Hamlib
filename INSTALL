Basic Installation
==================

For more information specific to Hamlib, please read the README.md as well as
README.betatester and the first part of README.developer to see which
additional development packages are needed. This source code distribution is
autoconfiguring and you should be able to compile it and install it without
manual interventions such as editing Makefiles, configuration files, and so
on. These are generic instructions for people who are not familiar with
installing autoconfiguring software (along with some Hamlib-specific
information).


The simplest way to compile this package is to enter the source code
main directory and do the following:

  1. Configure the source code by typing:

        If you check out the source code from github you need this step first
        $ ./bootstrap

        With the tar file or after the step above from a git clone
        $ ./configure

     If configure does not exist you can create it with ./bootstrap

     If you are planning to install the package into your home directory
     or to a location other than `/usr/local' then add the flag
     `--prefix=PATH' to `configure'. For example, if your home directory
     is `/home/username' and you would like to install it to a directory
     named 'local' you can configure the package to install itself
     there by invoking:

        $ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local

     The configure script has several options to configure Hamlib.  See the
     Optional Features section below.

     While running, `configure' prints some messages telling you which
     features it is checking for.

  2. Compile the package by typing:

        $ make

     Running `make' takes a while.  Since Hamlib is a package, now is the
     time to go get a cup of coffee.

  3. Some packages are bundled with self-tests for source-code verification.
     If this package includes such tests, you can optionally run them after
     compilation by typing

        $ make check

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation. Type `make uninstall' to undo the installation.

     N.B.  Be aware that Super User (root) privileges will be required to
     install to /usr/local or any other system location outside of your home
     directory.  Many distributions include the `sudo' command which will
     permit you to install Hamlib after entering your password.  Otherwise
     you will need to log in as 'root'.

     During installation, the following files go to the following directories:
        Executables          -> /prefix/bin
        Libraries            -> /prefix/lib
        Public header files  -> /prefix/include
        Man pages            -> /prefix/man/man?
        Info files           -> /prefix/info
        Doc files            -> /prefix/share/doc/<prog name>
        Share files          -> /prefix/share/<prog name>
     where `prefix' is either `/usr/local' or the PATH that you specified
     in the `--prefix' flag.

     If any of these directories do not presently exist, they will be
     created on demand.

     If you are installing in your home directory make sure that
     `/home/username/bin' is in your path. If you're using the bash shell
     add these lines at the end of your .bashrc file:

        PATH="/home/username/bin:${PATH}"
        export PATH

     If you are using csh or tcsh, then use this line instead:

        setenv PATH /home/username/bin:${PATH}

     By prepending your home directory to the rest of the PATH you can
     override systemwide installed software with your own custom installation.

  5. After installation you may need to update the ld.so.cache as the
     installation files are placed in /usr/local/lib by default.  On most
     systems this is easily accomplished by running the `ldconfig' command
     as the superuser (root).  The following line may need to be added to
     /etc/ld.so.conf:

        /usr/local/lib

     Most modern distributions have an /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ directory where
     local configuration can be made. Later versions of Debian and
     derivatives have a file named 'libc.conf' in this directory.  The
     contents of libc.conf are:

        # libc default configuration
        /usr/local/lib

     If your system does not have such a file, one will need to be created
     and then `ldconfig' will need to be run as the root user so that
     applications using the Hamlib libraries can find them.

     Now `ldconfig' can be run.

     While the programs built along with Hamlib will probably work fine
     without running `ldconfig', experience has shown that precompiled
     binaries like Fldigi will not be able to find a locally compiled
     libhamlib.so.2 without updating the ld.so.cache.

  6. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  The
     `configure' program will need to be run again to recompile Hamlib.

  7. You can optionally generate the Doxygen documentation files:

        cd doc
        make doc

     The HTML output files are provided for binary releases on the hamlib.org
     web site.

  8. Finally, if you wish to remove Hamlib, run `make uninstall' as
     superuser (root), unless Hamlib was installed into your home directory,
     from the Hamlib source directory.  This will work unless `make distclean'
     has been run.

Compiler configuration (Advanced usage)
=======================================

   The `configure' shell script is responsible for choosing and configuring
the compiler(s).

All programs are compiled with optimization level 2 by default (-O2).
Occasionally that confuses the debugger when code is inlined. To disable
optimization and enable debugging, set the shell environment variables
CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS. On the bash shell, you can do this like this:

  $ export CFLAGS="-g"
  $ export CXXFLAGS="-g"

On the tcsh shell, use the `setenv' command instead:

  % setenv CFLAGS "-g"
  ...etc...

For other shells, please consult your shell's documentation.

Similarly, you can increase the optimization level by assigning these
variables to "-O3".

These variables may also follow all options on the configure command line:

    ./configure --prefix="$HOME/local" [more options] \
    CFLAGS="-g -O0" \
    CXXFLAGS="-g -O0"

which will set the installation path to the the directory named 'local' under
user's home directory(executables will be installed to $HOME/local/bin,
header files to $HOME/local/include, and so on) and tells the C and C++
compilers to enable debugging symbols and disable optimizations.

N.B. When setting environment variables on the configure command line, always
put them last so the configure script is aware of them and can store them in
the cache.  When placed before the configure script on the command line, they
cannot be cached.

Depending on what languages the package uses, some of these options may
or may not be available. To see what is available, type:

    % sh ./configure --help

About the configure script
==========================

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README.md' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.ac' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoreconf'.  You only need `configure.ac' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.  This
project uses a custom `bootstrap' for running autoreconf in a developer's
checkout of Hamlib from a source repository.

Advanced installation options.
==============================

   The `configure' script also understands the following more advanced
options, to handle situations for which `--prefix' alone is not sufficient.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

Optional Features
=================

   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README.md' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
package recognizes.

   The configure script enables both shared and static Hamlib library builds
by default.  In some cases only one or the other is needed.  The following
options control the type of library:

    --disable-shared            # Only build a static library
    --disable-static            # Only build a shared library

   Shared libraries (DLLs on Windows) are used most often, however, there are
times when it is desirable to have Hamlib included as a built-in part of an
application which the use a static library (see Static Build below).

MS Windows
==========
- Debian system with mingw32msvc cross-compiler

    ./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc

- Debian system with MinGW W64 cross-compiler for Windows 32 bit

    ./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32

- Specifying the directory of libusb-1.0 for a Windows build using MinGW as
  libusb-1.0 must be installed separately, use the following environment
  variables after all other options.

    ./configure [other options] \
    CPPFLAGS="-I/path_to_libusb-1.0/include" \
    LDFLAGS="-L/path_to_libusb-1.0/lib/gcc"

- Mingw compiler under Cygwin

    ./configure --host=i686-pc-mingw32 \
    CC="gcc -mno-cygwin" \
    CXX="g++ -mno-cygwin"

- Cygwin
    Native Cygwin requires no special options besides regular ones.

N.B. See the 'build-win32.sh' script and its associated README.build-win32 file
in the 'scripts' directory for complete details on building a Windows 32 binary
with MSVCC library support.

Hamlib Specific Features
========================

    Various Hamlib features requiring the presence of third party packages are
enabled with options beginning with '--with-'.  At this time these options
are:

  --with-xml-support      build rigmem with XML support [default=no]
  --without-readline      disable readline in rigctl/rotctl [default=yes]
  --without-cxx-binding   do not build C++ binding and demo [default=yes]
  --with-perl-binding     build perl binding and demo [default=no]
  --with-perl-inc         directory containing perl includes
  --with-python-binding   build python binding and demo [default=no]
  --with-tcl-binding      build Tcl binding and demo [default=no]
  --with-tcl=PATH         directory containing tcl configuration (tclConfig.sh)
  --with-lua-binding      build lua binding and demo [default=no]
  --without-indi          disable INDI rotator support [default=no]

    Optional features that may require specialized hardware are:

  --disable-html-matrix   do not generate HTML rig feature matrix (requires
                          libgd-dev) [default=check]
  --disable-winradio      do not build winradio backend [default=yes]
  --enable-usrp           build USRP backend [default=no]

Bindings notes
--------------

   Should you encounter any problem with the build of the C++ binding,
you can disable this optional part by passing `--without-cxx-binding'
to the configure script (may happen under MacOSX).

    Note that the Perl, Python, Lua and TCL bindings are disabled by default so
they will need to be specifically enabled for language binding support (this
has no effect on rigctld/rotctld).  You may get a make error (which means it
will quit before compilation is complete) if the
--with-[perl|python|tcl|lua]-binding option(s) are given and the Swig package
is not installed.

    Perl and Python bindings should be installed into a 'configure' runtime
discovered location under the default prefix.

    The TCL binding will be installed into $(libdir)/tcl/Hamlib (default).  If a
non-default --prefix is passed to 'configure', the 'lappend' line in tcltest.tcl
script will need to be modified accordingly so the script can load the Hamlib
package.  As TCL doesn't seem to have a "standard" location for additional
packages and since there seemed to be no common location among distributions,
this path was chosen arbitrarily.  Any patches to improve installation path
discovery of local packages are welcome.

    Lua binding will be installed into $(libdir)/lua/$(LUA_VERSION) (default).
For non-default settings, see notes at other bindings.

    When running 'make uninstall' the installed files for the Python, Lua and TCL
modules are removed.  The Perl files will remain due to a design decision
of the Perl MakeMaker module.  Installed Perl binding files will need to be
removed manually.

Static Build
============

Note, the following is still experimental.

   As noted above, there are times when including Hamlib as part of an
application may be thought to ease its distribution.  As a static library is
built by default the following notes may assist application authors.

   The 'kit' backend depends on libusb-1.0.  To link libusb-1.0 statically set the
following environment variable on the 'configure' command line:

    LIBUSB_LIBS="/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libusb-1.0.a"

do note that the absolute path to 'libusb-1.0.a' may well be quite different on
other systems.

   By default the GNU linker (ld) will include most all symbols in a static
library into the executable.  As it may be desired to only include the actual
symbols used by the application, set the following environment variables on
the command line of the application's 'configure' script:

    CFLAGS="-fdata-sections -ffunction-sections" LDFLAGS="-Wl,--gc-sections"

These can be set on the Hamlib 'configure' script's command line to see the
effect on the Hamlib utilities when they are built as statically linked
applicatins (--disable-shared option passed to 'configure').  With these
environment variables it can be seen that 'rigctl' contains no rotor symbols
nor does 'rotctl' contain any rig symbols.

   Combining the above, everything above may be put together:

    ./configure --disable-shared --prefix="$HOME/local" --without-cxx-binding \
    --disable-winradio CFLAGS="-fdata-sections -ffunction-sections" \
    LDFLAGS="-Wl,--gc-sections" LIBUSB_LIBS="/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libusb-1.0.a"

to make a static only Hamlib library, statically link libusb-1.0, and include only
the needed symbols in the Hamlib utilities linking to libhamlib.a.
