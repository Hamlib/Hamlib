        * rot_get_conf deprecated and replaced by rot_get_conf2
        * Change FT1000MP Mark V model names to align with FT1000MP

Version 4.6.1
        * Fix C++ builds failing on rig_list_foreach function
        * Fix IC9100 rigctld startup to end up on VFOA
        * Fix grig build by removing sys/socket.h -- apparently not needed
        * Add new QMX entry to fix incompability with QDX

	* send_raw can now take hex digits as colon-separated -- e.g. send_raw icom xfe:xfe:x94:xe0:03:xfd
	* Add IC7760
        * IC7300 Mode filter can now be set by # (i.e. 1,2,3) 
        * Fixed AF6SA WRC rotor controller
        * Added Rhode&Schwarz XK852
        * Added Xiegu X6200
        * Added Commradio CTX-10
        * Added Guoehe PMR-171

        * Added Flex SmartSDR slices A-H
        * Added Motorola Micom M2/M3
        * Added SDR Radio SDRConsole -- TS-2000 is now hardware flow control so need separate entry
        * Added --set-conf=filter_usb, filter_usbd, and filter_cw to allow Icom rigs set mode to set filter number too
        * Added macros for applications to obtain pointers to Hamlib structures(issues #1445, #1420, #487).
          Internal conversion is still a WIP, but use of these macros will make the final cutover transparent to applications. 
        * Added Guohe Q900 entry 
        * Unify behavior of all rigctl split commands
          * Make the set_split_* commands modify the state of the specified split VFO -- the current or targeted VFO do not have any effect
          * Make the set_split_* commands enable split automatically if not enabled
          * Make the get_split_* commands return frequency of 0 Hz, mode NONE and filter of 0 Hz if split is not enabled
          * Allow all split commands to avoid VFO swapping if supported by the rig model
        * Improve Icom backend to set/get frequency, mode and filter without VFO swapping if supported by the rig model
        * Improve Yaesu newcat backend split handling
        * Expose "Targetable features" (RIG_TARGETABLE_*) in dump_caps output to allow clients to determine which commands can be executed without VFO swapping
        * Added RIG_FUNC_SYNC for FTDX101D/MP
        * Added Barrett 4100
        * Added DL2MAN (tr)uSDX -- needs refinement

        * Added VOICE/CW memory capability to many rigs -- thanks to David Balharrie M0DGB/G8FKH
        * Add -# --skip_init option to rigctl to skip rig initialization -- useful for executing commands quickly
        * rig_caps is no longer constant -- this may break some 3rd party relying on the "const" declaration.  Here's an example of how to handle compatibility.
#ifdef RIGCAPS_NOT_CONST
static int add_to_list(struct rig_caps* rc, void*)
#else
static int add_to_list(const struct rig_caps* rc, void*)
#endif

        * IC7610 now has IPP, DPP, and TX_INHIBIT functions set/get

            'P BANDSELECT ?' shows  bands available for the rig
        * Added rig_cm108_get/set_bit to API and get/set_gpio to rigctl(d) for GPIO1,2,3,4 access on CM108

        * Add client_version to rigctld so client can report it's version for future use/compatibility/alternatives
        * Add --set-conf=tuner_control_pathname=hamlib_tuner_control (default)
          If file exists then it will be called with 0/1 (Off/On) argument
          with 'U TUNER 0' or 'U TUNER 1"
          Default path is for current directory

          This will allow CW Skimmer to work with some rigs (e.g. IC7300) using FM
          mode on VFOA and CW mode on VFOB and split mode transmit on VFOB.
          Clicking on CW Skimmer will change VFOB instead of VFOA to allow working
          dxpeditions where the fox is staying on frequency
        * Add password capability to rigctld via -A switch. 
          rigctld -A will produce a consistent shared key for any specific password that can used in \password and rig_set_password
          TBD The shared key can also be placed in .hamlib_settings 
        * Asynchronous rig data output handling to support transceive and spectrum data. Mikael, OH3BHX
          Example for the IC-7300 to multicast on port 20001 and provide async rig information
          rigctld --port=20001 --model=3073 --serial-speed=115200 --rig-file=/dev/serial/... --set-conf=rts_state=OFF --set-conf=dtr_state=OFF --multicast-addr=224.0.0.1 --multicast-port=20001 --set-conf=async=1
          Also, spectrum data output needs to be enabled with: \set_func SPECTRUM 1
        * See new set_conf option async for some Icom rigs
        * Multicast UDP packet output for asynchronous data. Mikael, OH3BHX
        * Rig state poll routine to serve commonly used data like frequency and mode from cache. Mikael, OH3BHX
        * deprecated hamlib_port_t at front of rig_state structure -- new one at end of structure
        * New rig_send_raw to send/read raw command to rig
        * New RIG_LEVEL_BAND_SELECT for Yaesu rigs
        * New rig_get_conf2 to replace rig_get_conf buffer overflow potential
        * New rot_get_conf2 to reaplce rot_get_conf buffer overflow potential
        * Added Barrett 4050 -- not functional yet
        * Added TCI 1.X -- not functional yet

        * Added CODAN Envoy and NGS
        * Added Lab599 TX-500
        * Added GOMSPACE GS100
        * Deprecated: rigctl commands \set_trn (A) and \get_trn (a) as they never worked as intended
        * Deprecated: field rig_caps.transceive and RIG_TRN_* macros

Version 4.4
        * 2021-12-02
        * Icom rigs now default filter 2 when setting PKTUSB but user can override 
        * Fix FTDX9000 meter readings
        * Add Android sensor as a rotator
        * Added rig_get_vfo to some Icom rigs that have XCHG or 0x25 command capability
        * Added ability to build hamlib with docker
        * Added M0NKA mcHF URP rig
        * Faster serial i/o noticeable on higher baud rates
        * IC7300/9700/7800/785x set_clock/get_clock routines added -- no auto set yet
        * Yaesu FT1200/891/991/DX10/DX101/DX101MP set_clock/get_clock routines added

Version 4.3.1
        * 2021-09-14
        * Bug fix release
            - Do not do vfo_fixup on satmode rigs
            - Fix compilation of misc.c with gmtime_r replacement function for
              mingw
            - Fix python build.  For some reason casting tp vfo_t in the
              RIG_VFO_N macro broke the swig parsing
            - Append the missing information to build hamlib v4.3 for Android
              NDK
            - Change set_icom_set_mode_with_data to not change mode unless
              necessary
            - Since Icom rigs default to filter 2 if a filter is not selected
              we will do the same when turning on data mode
            - Fix segfault in kenwood_set_vfo
            - scripts: Update example in readme, since 4.0 817 is 1020
            - Make testlibusb.c compatible with libusb < 1.0.23
              Note: On systems with libusb < 1.0.23 a warning will be emitted
              but compilation should proceed without error.
            - Update testlibusb.c warning to "may be" instead of "will be"
            - Change kenwood to only set VFOA default on 1st rig_open call

Version 4.3
        * 2021-09-01
        * libusb-1.0.23 or greater is now required or use --without-libusb
        * Generating documentation now requires GNU source-highlighter.
        * Added IC-575
        * Less VFO swapping of newer Icom rigs -- zero swapping in WSJTX and JTDX
        * Dual rotator control in rotctl -R option
        * Started work on simulators -- very crude right now but usable to debug some things
        * Overhaul of rig split -- reverse split (VFOA=RX VFOB=TX) should work for rigs capable of it
          Starting VFO does not matter -- rig will end up on RX VFO
          S VFOA 1 VFOB
          S VFOB 1 VFOA
          S Main 1 Sub
          S Sub 1 Main

Version 4.2
        * 2021-05-17
        * New rig_get_mode_bandwidths -- returns token set for bandwidths for given mode
              Rig command: \get_mode_bandwidths CW
              Mode=CW
              Normal=500Hz
              Narrow=50Hz
              Wide=2400Hz
        * New rig_get_info  -- returns token set for all vfos where order does not matter
          This is a string return to allow for easy future expansion without changing the API
          New tokens may be introduced and can be skipped if not used by clients
              Rig command: \get_rig_info
              VFO=Main Freq=145000000 Mode=None Width=0 RX=1 TX=1
              VFO=VFOB Freq=145000000 Mode=FM Width=15000 RX=0 TX=0
              Split=0 SatMode=0
              Rig=Dummy
              App=Hamlib
              Version=20210429
              CRC=0xf49f4708
        * New rig_get_vfo_info
              Rig command: \get_vfo_info VFOA

        * Added Malachite SDR
        * Major rework for PRM80
        * Add twiddle_timeout and twiddle_rit --set-conf options
              rigctld --set-conf=twiddle_timeout=5,twiddle_rit=1
              This will set the twiddle timeout to 5 seconds and turn on twiddle_rit
              For twiddle timeout VFOB will not be polled for 5 seconds after VFO twiddling
	      is detected
        * rigctld --twiddle is deprecated and will be removed in 5.0 along with
          get_twiddle and set_twiddle
        * Rework Doxygen manual including default layout for Doxygen 1.9.1.  So far
          the amplifier, rotator, and utilities API sections have been updated.  The
          rig (radio) section remains to be updated.

Version 4.1
        2021-01-31
        * rigctld and rigs should be more robust for disconnect problems
        * Several fixes for Icom and Yaesu rigs
        * Nobody should need to use rig->caps or rig->state anymore

          file.
        * Add new general project manual pages (section 7) and edit the Info
          manual to match.  These should not change much so keeping them in
          sync should not be too much of a burden.  The Info manual may be
          removed at some point in the future.
        * Last planned release of the present API/ABI.  Future releases will
          require recompilation and relinking by client programs using the C
          library interface (programs that only use the network daemons should
          be unaffected).

	2015-09-20
	* Kill RPC backends and rpc.rigd/rpc.rotd
	* Remove -e|--end-marker option from rigctld and rotctld
	* Build system updates--remove obsolete macros, autogen.sh now
		runs autoreconf to invoke Autotools to bootstrap the build
		system, libltdl is installed into the source tree as a part
		of the build system bootstrap and is included in the source
		tarball, ABI version is set to be compatible with the 1.2
		series, all Autotools installed files are copied rather than
		symlinked and put in the build-aux directory, building
		rigmem and rigmatrix are now user selectable at configure
		run time, building static libraries are disabled by default.
		Fixed TCL binding installation, fixed Perl binding build so it
		is not invoked by 'make dist' and clean up build files.  Cleaned
		up bindings builds to occur in alphabetical order.  Use new
		ax_pkg_swig macro and update ax_python_devel macro.  Test for
		presence of pkg-config before testing for pkg-config use.
	* Implement new RIT/XIT activation/deactivation through rig_get/set_func()
	* IC-PCR1500/2500 default write_delay to 0, IC-746/756, IC-PCR8500

		HTML files are built and distributed, requires makeinfo.
	* Android build system support.  See android/README.android.  Android
		Makefile fragments are included in source tarballs.
	* Monolithic library, thanks to Remi Chateauneu for the majority of
		the work!  This allows enabling of a single static library so
		static libs are enabled by default.  Removes dependency on libltdl.
	* Fixes to easycomm, TNX Steve AI4QR.
	* Fixes to port handling allowing PTT and CAT on the same port.  TNX
		Bill, G4WJS.
	* New Peaberry models V1 and V2 added to kit backend.  TNX ON8VQ
		and R2AEE.
	* New IC-7100 model.  TNX Martin, CT1IQI.
	* Use AC_CHECK_LIB macro to search for libusb rather than rely on
	    pkg-config.  Preserve environment variables LIBUSB_CFLAGS and
	    LIBUSB_LIBS as user precious variables.  Two features,
	    --with-xml-support and --enable-usrp still rely on pkg-config so
	    only invoke pkg-config when either or both of these features are
	    selected.  Only the Winradio g313 model uses libdl so test for it
	    only when Winradio backend is enabled.
