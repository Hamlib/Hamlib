Please send Hamlib bug reports to hamlib-developer@lists.sourceforge.net

Version 4.3
    Add twiddle_timeout and twiddle_rit --set-conf options
        rigctld --set-conf=twiddle_timeout=5,twiddle_rit=1 
        This will set the twiddle timeout to 5 seconds and turn on twiddle_rit
        For twiddle timeout VFOB will not be polled for 5 seconds after VFO twiddling is detected
    rigctld --twiddle is deprecated and will be removed in 5.0 along with get_twiddle and set_twiddle

Version 4.2
        2021-??-??
        * Major rework for PRM80

Version 4.1
        2021-01-31
        * rigctld and rigs should be more robust for disconnect problems
        * Several fixes for Icom and Yaesu rigs
        * Nobody should need to use rig->caps or rig->state anymore
             If you need a variable added please contact us.
             Note that rig->state abstraction is not implemented yet...no need known
        * New rig_get_caps_int and rig_get_caps_cptr functions to replace using caps-> values
        * New rig_get_function to replace using caps-> function pointers
        * Fix shared library problem with WSJTX, JTDX, and JS8Call
        * New model Barrett 950

Version 4.0
        2020-11-29
        * API/ABI changes, advance ABI to 4 0 0.
        * Add GPIO and GPION options for DCD.  Jeroen Vreeken
        * New backend: ELAD FDM DUO.  Giovanni, HB9EIK.
        * New RIG_LEVEL_RFPOWER_METER_WATTS level
        * All channel functions now take a vfo argument
	* New rotator backend: iOptron. Bob, KD8CGH
	* New model: Icom IC-R8600.  Ekki, DF4OR
	* New utility: rigctlcom.  Mike, W9MDB
	* New model: FT847UNI for unidirectional early serial numbers.  Mike, W9MDB
	* Remove GNU Texinfo files and build system dependency.
        * Rig model numbers have changed to allow future growth
	* Fix a lot of static code analysis errors and warnings.  Mike, W9MDB
	* Rearrange directory structure to put rigs and rotators sources
	  under their own subdirectories.  Mike, W9MDB
        * rig_get_channel changed to add read_only flag.
        * rigctl(d) f command also returns VFO now.
        * caching of vfo, frequency, mode, and ptt speeds up rigctld for all.
        * caching of kenwood/yaesu "IF" speeds up polling from WSJTX/JTDX.
        * rig_get_channel now has read_only flag but it still needs to be
          implemented based on rig behavior, so if you use rig_get_channel you
          may get a RIG_ENIMPL error to contact us for fixing it.
        * New rig backend for Elecraft K4.
        * New rig backend for PowerSDR (Flex and Apache users).
        * Many fixes and enhancements.  Mike, W9MDB and many contributors
        * PTT port is no longer shared by default, use --set-conf=ptt_share=1 to enable

Version 3.3
        2018-08-12
        * New models, R&S xk2100, TRXMAnager, Meade LX200
        * HTML manual is now generated at 'make dist' so users don't
          need GNU Info tools installed.  TNX Greg, N1DAM for the suggestion.
        * Handle longer udev generated file names up to 512 characters
        * Add debug time stamps with new '-Z' option and '--debug-time-stamps'
          options to rigctl, rotctl, rigctld, and rotctld utilities.
        * rigctld/rotctld continue working after serial or TCP device
          disappears.
        * Updates and fixes to FT-817, K3, IC-7300, AOR 3030, TM-D710,
          OMNI VII, TH-D72, Flrig, TS-590, piHPSDR, TS-2000, and netrigctl.
        * Update utility manual pages (section 1) and remove their reference
          material from the Info manual so it only needs to be update in one
          file.
        * Add new general project manual pages (section 7) and edit the Info
          manual to match.  These should not change much so keeping them in
          sync should not be too much of a burden.  The Info manual may be
          removed at some point in the future.
        * Last planned release of the present API/ABI.  Future releases will
          require recompilation and relinking by client programs using the C
          library interface (programs that only use the network daemons should
          be unaffected).

Version 3.0
	2015-09-20
	* Kill RPC backends and rpc.rigd/rpc.rotd
	* Remove -e|--end-marker option from rigctld and rotctld
	* Build system updates--remove obsolete macros, autogen.sh now
		runs autoreconf to invoke Autotools to bootstrap the build
		system, libltdl is installed into the source tree as a part
		of the build system bootstrap and is included in the source
		tarball, ABI version is set to be compatible with the 1.2
		series, all Autotools installed files are copied rather than
		symlinked and put in the build-aux directory, building
		rigmem and rigmatrix are now user selectable at configure
		run time, building static libraries are disabled by default.
		Fixed TCL binding installation, fixed Perl binding build so it
		is not invoked by 'make dist' and clean up build files.  Cleaned
		up bindings builds to occur in alphabetical order.  Use new
		ax_pkg_swig macro and update ax_python_devel macro.  Test for
		presence of pkg-config before testing for pkg-config use.
	* Implement new RIT/XIT activation/deactivation through rig_get/set_func()
	* IC-PCR1500/2500 default write_delay to 0, IC-746/756, IC-PCR8500
		fixes, pcr.c, pcr1500.c: Add DSP support.  TNX Paul, KE7ZZ
	* WinRadio G313 updates.  TNX Julian Campbel
	* Readline editing and history support added to rigctl interactive
		mode.  Implement options for reading and writing history file.
	* Readline editing and history support added to rotctl interactive
		mode.  Implement options for reading and writing history file.
	* A new manual draft written in Texinfo added.  Both GNU Info and single
		HTML files are built and distributed, requires makeinfo.
	* Android build system support.  See android/README.android.  Android
		Makefile fragments are included in source tarballs.
	* Monolithic library, thanks to Remi Chateauneu for the majority of
		the work!  This allows enabling of a single static library so
		static libs are enabled by default.  Removes dependency on libltdl.
	* Fixes to easycomm, TNX Steve AI4QR.
	* Fixes to port handling allowing PTT and CAT on the same port.  TNX
		Bill, G4WJS.
	* New Peaberry models V1 and V2 added to kit backend.  TNX ON8VQ
		and R2AEE.
	* New IC-7100 model.  TNX Martin, CT1IQI.
	* Use AC_CHECK_LIB macro to search for libusb rather than rely on
	    pkg-config.  Preserve environment variables LIBUSB_CFLAGS and
	    LIBUSB_LIBS as user precious variables.  Two features,
	    --with-xml-support and --enable-usrp still rely on pkg-config so
	    only invoke pkg-config when either or both of these features are
	    selected.  Only the Winradio g313 model uses libdl so test for it
	    only when Winradio backend is enabled.
	* New IC-M700PRO, IC-M710, IC-M802.
	* New Icom ID-5100 model.
	* New rotor, cnctrk by KI4SBL
	* Many backend fixes and updates from many contributors (see Git
	  log for complete details).
