This is android port of hamlib
(C) 2012 Ladislav Vaiz <ok1zia@nagano.cz>

Notes:
* use hamlib-compile script to build hamlib for android
* script deletes file include/config.h, it conflicts with android/config.h
* android port implements ltdl interface and calls dlfcn functions directly
* RPC is not present on android
* ARS backend is compiled without pthreads because of deprecated pthread_cancel
* I don'k know how to connect to real radio:
** Bluetooth API is available only under Java, not from native code
** FTDI USB to serial converter driver is not included in standard kernel. It should work on rooted device.
** But NET rigctl works fine
* Backends are named libhamlib-vendor.so, I don't know how to include libraries without lib prefix into APK
* Check the location of libusb.h and define the corresponding macro accordingly in config.h.
* Had to build without libusb as ndk did not contain it
** comment out HAVE_LIBUSB_H in android/config.h if you get libusb errors

Happy hacking
