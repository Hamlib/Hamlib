The following email describes the command set used by the Rotor-EZ
interface for Hy-Gain rotors and the RotorCard interface for Yaesu
rotors manufactured and sold by Idiom Press, http://www.idiompres.com

The Hy-Gain DCU-1/DCU-1X Digital Control Unit supports a subset of
these commands--AP1XXX; and AM1;  The DCU-1/DCU-1X is manufactured 
and sold by Hy-Gain, http://www.hy-gain.com

Here you go:

Important note:  The program you are using must insert leading zeros into
bearing commands, such as "009" degrees, instead of "9" degrees. Most
programs are already configured this way, but some are not in their default
mode, and in such cases you must change the default setting or the RS-232
portion of Rotor-EZ will not work properly.

Rotor-EZ can also be commanded from any terminal having RS232 output, using
the following configuration: 4800 baud, 8,N,1    Note that upper case/lower
case must be used as listed for the commands below to work:

"AP1xxx<CR>" sets target bearing to "xxx" degrees where xxx are three digits
between 000 and 360, and executes. A typical command to rotate to 080
degrees would be AP1080<CR> Note that the <CR> is often labeled <Enter> on
many keyboards.

"AP1xxx;"   sets the target bearing but does not execute.
"AM1;"      executes rotation to the bearing set by the "AP1xxx;" command
"AI1;"      inquires current bearing; and responds with (000-359) degrees
";"         terminates rotation
"E"         enable endpoint option - effective immediately
"e"         disable endpoint option - effective immediately
"O"         enable overshoot option - effective immediately
"o"         disable overshoot option - effective immediately
"S"         enable unstick option - effective immediately
"s"         disable unstick option - effective immediately
"V"         reports version number
"J"         enable jam protection - effective immediately
"j"         disable jam protection - effective immediately - NOT recommended!

Note that during any rotation initiated by an RS232 command, the rotation
can be halted and further rotation cancelled by a momentary press of the
Brake paddle. Also, an RS232 operation can be overridden by using the
pointing control during rotation; when the control is moved rotation will
cease and  the control will wait for a new command after the five second
brake delay is completed.
