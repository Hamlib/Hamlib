The scripts/ directory will contain helper scripts for building Hamlib
binary releases for Win32 and possibly other target platforms.  Each
script should be accompanied by a companion README file with information
on the script and build requirements.

Scripts:

build-win32.sh for building Win32 DLLs and EXEs for use with MS VC++.

build-VB.NET.sh for building Win32 DLLs and EXEs for use with MS VB.NET
2002 Framework 1.1

hamlib.nsi for building an executable installer for Win32.
