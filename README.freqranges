Frequency ranges are being changed to reflect rig capabilities instead of
region restrictions

As of 2020-05-05 the behavior is:

#1 Any range which shows ITU# or TBD has not been modified to this convention
#2 Ranges on the backends are being changed to USA/EUR/KOR/TPE/ITR per the
 IC-9700 convention.  So if you see one of those monikers on a rig's freq
 range it should accurately reflect the rig's capabilities.

Note that most rigs will have just USA or USA/EUR models.  Not too many rigs
have more than 2 models but it appears at least Icom is headed that way.

USA - United States of America
EUR - Europe
KOR - Korea
TPE - Japan
ITR - ??
AUS - Australia
CHN - China
