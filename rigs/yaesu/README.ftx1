Yaesu FTX-1 Hamlib Backend
==========================

Quirks, known bugs, and other notes for the FTX-1 transceiver.

Authors:
    Terrell Deppe (KJ5HST) - Primary implementation

Head Type Detection
===================
The FTX-1 comes in multiple configurations with different power ranges:

    Field Head (Battery):   0.5W - 6W
    Field Head (12V):       0.5W - 10W
    Optima/SPA-1:           5W - 100W

The driver automatically detects the configuration at rig_open() using a
two-stage process:

    Stage 1: PC Command Format
        PC1xxx response = Field Head
        PC2xxx response = Optima/SPA-1

    Stage 2: Power Probe (Field Head only)
        Attempts to set 8W power
        If accepted: 12V power source (0.5-10W range)
        If rejected: Battery power source (0.5-6W range)

The original power setting is saved and restored after probing.

Clarifier
=========
Uses CF command (spec page 8). See ftx1_clarifier.c for implementation.

Tuning Steps
============
Two methods are available:

    TS command - Basic tuning step (00-14 codes)
        Works but not mode-aware

    EX0306 command - Mode-specific dial steps
        EX030601 = SSB/CW:   0=5Hz, 1=10Hz, 2=20Hz
        EX030602 = RTTY/PSK: 0=5Hz, 1=10Hz, 2=20Hz
        EX030603 = FM:       0=5kHz, 1=6.25kHz, 2=10kHz, 3=12.5kHz,
                             4=20kHz, 5=25kHz, 6=Auto

Memory Channels
===============
The FTX-1 uses a different memory format than documented:

    MR/MT/MZ commands use 5-digit channel format (MR00001, not MR0001)
    MC command uses 6-digit format without VFO prefix
    CH command only accepts CH0 (up) and CH1 (down), not CH;

CW Operations
=============
    send_morse  - Uses KY0<message>; (up to 24 characters)
    stop_morse  - Uses KY0; with no message
    wait_morse  - Stub (FTX-1 cannot query CW TX status)

Tuner (SPA-1 Only)
==================
The AC (Antenna Tuner) command only works when the Optima/SPA-1 amplifier
is connected. The driver guards against calling AC commands when SPA-1 is
not detected.

Firmware Quirks
===============
Tested with FTX-1 firmware v1.08+. Known discrepancies from CAT manual:

    BS          Set-only, no query capability
    ZI          Only works in CW mode (MD03 or MD07)
    VM          Mode codes: 00=VFO, 11=Memory (not 01 as documented)
    GP          Requires menu setting: TUN/LIN PORT SELECT = "GPO"

General Notes
=============
    - Radio must be polled for status (no transceive mode)
    - Serial: 38400 baud default, 8N1, no hardware flow control
    - Post-write delay of 50ms recommended for reliable operation
    - Radio ID (ID;) always returns 0840 for all configurations
