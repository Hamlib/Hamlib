hamlib-1.2.5 aor.c ar5000.c

The previous AR5000 could:
- get and set frequency.
- read mode if radio were not set to SAH, SAL or SAM.
- not set mode. Radio did not accept two commands to be sent at once.
- not return VFO-name if rig were set to VFO D or VFO E.
- not set VFO D or VFO E.
- vfo_op Up and Down works, but radio returns a "?", resulting in "Protocol error".
- get_info does not work.
- not read AGC-level.


Now, it:
- can get and set frequency.
- can read and set (all) modes.
- still does not support VFO D & E. I probably have not understood how VFO_N(3) and VFO_N(4) are meant to be used :-(
- can read AGC-level.


- corrected channel description size from 12 to 8.
- filter-list mode/bw rearranged.
- list of tuning steps corrected.
